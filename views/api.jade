          h2.content-subhead Defaults

          p.
            The defaults for Persona Assistant are as follows. These are independent of which mode you specify.
            However, they will be accentuated with any extra defaults (below) dependent on the mode you choose.
            If you choose to pass in an invalid mode, then these defaults are the only ones applied to your
            options.

          pre.
            {
              mode                   : 'classic',
              loggedInSelector       : '.persona-logged-in',
              loadingSelector        : '.persona-loading',
              loggedOutSelector      : '.persona-logged-out',
              loginBtnSelector       : '.persona-login',
              logoutBtnSelector      : '.persona-logout',
              showEmailSelector      : '.persona-email'
              loginJsonUrl           : '/login.json',
              logoutUrl              : '/logout',
              onLoading              : function() {},
              onCancel               : function() {}
            }

          h3.content-subhead mode

          p.
            The 'mode' parameter is essentially a set of defaults so that it is easy for you to set up
            Persona Assistant. The following options are set when you specify either <code>classic</code>
            or <code>application</code> mode.

          h4.content-subhead classic

          p.
            For <code>classic</code> mode, there are no extra defaults besides the regular defaults (above).

          h4.content-subhead application

          p.
            For <code>application</code> mode, the following defaults are added to your options, which you may also
            override if necessary.

          pre.
            {
              logoutJsonUrl          : '/logout.json',
              onLogoutRemoveSelector : '.persona-logout-remove',
              onLogin                : function(result) {},
              onLogout               : function() {}
            }

          h2.content-subhead Config

          p
            | These options allow you to change certain properties of how Persona acts. Mostly the same list as 
            a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/navigator.id.request") navigator.id.request()
            | .


          h3.content-subhead siteName
          p.
            Plain text name of your site to show in the login's dialog box.

          h3.content-subhead backgroundColor
          p.
            Changes the background color of the login's dialog box. Should be '#rgb' or '#rrggbb'.

          h3.content-subhead siteLogo
          p.
            Absolute path to the site's logo. Must be served over https.

          h3.content-subhead privacyPolicy and termsOfService
          p.
            Absolute path to the site's privacy policy. Must be served over https.
          p.
            Absolute path to the site's privacy policy. Must be served over https.
          p.
            Both of these must be provided or none at all.

          h2.content-subhead Element Selectors

          p.
            These options allow you to change which elements you want to attach events onto (such as click) and
            which elements you'd like to show or hide at various intervals.

          h3.content-subhead loggedInSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-logged-in'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used when showing which elements you want to show when a user is logged in. The selector
            is passed straight to <code>$(loggedInSelector).hide()</code>.

          h3.content-subhead loadingSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-loading'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used when showing which elements you want to show when Persona is loading to see if a user
            is logged in or not. The selector is passed straight to <code>$(loadingSelecter).hide()</code>.

          h3.content-subhead loggedOutSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-logged-out'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used when showing which elements you want to show when a user is logged out. The selector
            is passed straight to <code>$(loggedOutSelector).hide()</code>. When in 'classic' mode, you may choose
            not to have any of these elements on the screen, since you will probably be refreshing the entire page
            anyway (if the selector selects zero DOM elements, that's fine).

          h3.content-subhead loginBtnSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-login'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used so that Persona Assistant knows which elements are login buttons/links. It attaches
            a <code>.click()</code> handler to the element(s) and instigates a login action.

          h3.content-subhead logoutBtnSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-logout'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used so that Persona Assistant knows which elements are logout buttons/links. It attaches
            a <code>.click()</code> handler to the element(s) and instigates a logout action.

          h3.content-subhead showEmailSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-email'</code>
          p.
            This selector is used to show the email address of the person who has just logged in. The element's <code>.text(email)</code>
            is set so that you can show the user which email address they have just used. In some cases you may not want to do this since
            the email address references an account with a user name/id, so this is just a helper if you need it. It is set as follows:
            <code>$(showEmailSelector).text(email)</code>

          h3.content-subhead loginJsonUrl
          p.
            Default: <code>'/login.json'</code>
          p.
            This is the URL which is hit when Persona Assistant has received the <code>assertion</code> inside the 
            <code>onlogin</code> callback of the <code>navigator.id.watch</code>. The URL is loaded via an Ajax POST
            request and contains the <code>assertion</code> so that the server can verify it.
          p.
            Examples of verifying the assertion can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid-cookbook/">BrowserID Cookbook</a>.
          p.
            The server should return a JSON data structure with the following fields:
          pre.
            {
              ok    : false|true, // if true, the assertion was ok
              email : '...',      // the verified email (only if 'ok' is true)
              msg   : '...',      // the failure message (if 'ok' is false)
            }
          p.
            Depending on whether <code>ok</code> is true or false, will mean whether we then use <code>email</code> or <code>msg</code>.

          h3.content-subhead logoutUrl
          p.
            Default: <code>'/logout'</code>
          p.
            This URL is used to set the <code>window.location</code> when in 'classic' mode and the user clicks the logout button/link.
            It isn't used in the regular flow when in 'application' mode, however it is used as a fallback if the <code>logoutJsonUrl</code>
            fails (see below).
          p.
            This page should tear down your users session on the server, and perhaps redirect somewhere else (such as <code>/</code> or
            <code>/home</code>.

          h3.content-subhead logoutJsonUrl
          p.
            Default: <code>'/logout.json'</code>
          p.
            We hit this URL in 'application' mode only. This page should tear down the session on the server and return a data structure
            such as the following:
          pre.
            {
              ok : true
            }
          p.
            Once the session has been torn down, we then perform other housekeeping such as deleting various elements from the page,
            hiding any elements related to being logged in and showing any elements related to being logged out.
          p.
            It is used in 'application' mode only.

          h3.content-subhead onLogoutRemoveSelector
          p.
            Default: <code>'.persona-logout-remove'</code>
          p.
            This selector will be used when we want to remove various elements from the page once the user has been logged out.
          p.
            It is used in 'application' mode only.

          h2.content-subhead Events

          p These functions are called at specific times during the login/logout process (and sometimes in betwee).

          h3.content-subhead onLogin
          p.
            Default: <code>function(result){}</code>
          p.
            This function is called once we know that a user has logged in successfully. It is also passed the data structure
            which is returned from the <code>loginJsonUrl</code> (see above). This means that you can also pass back some extra
            pieces of information, such as the username, user id, how many unread messages they have or anything else you would
            like to show the user. You can also use this event to fire off other requests to the server or perform any other
            DOM manipulation.

          h3.content-subhead onLogout
          p.
            Default: <code>function(){}</code>
          p.
            This function is called once we know that a user has logged out successfully. It is not passed any extra data.

          h3.content-subhead onLoading
          p.
            Default: <code>function(){}</code>
          p.
            This function is called once we start asking Persona if the user is logged in or not. It is not passed any extra data.

          h3.content-subhead onCancel
          p.
            Default: <code>function(){}</code>
          p.
            This function is called once if the user cancels the Persona login process.
